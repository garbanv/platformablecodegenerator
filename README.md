You might want to look into gatsby-config.js to user your own metadata
## Usage

npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run gatsby develop to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:8000

In our case we use Strapi as our backend for getting the media images of our live site but feel free to use the Headless CMS of your preference or just change the config to match your Strapi backend.
